# Smart Parking System

## Overview
The Smart Parking System is a real-time vehicle detection, tracking, and monitoring solution powered by **YOLO** (You Only Look Once) and **OCR** (Optical Character Recognition). It enables automated parking management by detecting and tracking vehicles, recognizing license plates, and logging entry/exit timestamps.

# Features
- **Real-time Vehicle Detection** – Uses YOLO to identify vehicles with high accuracy.
- **Object Tracking** – Prevents duplicate counts by uniquely tracking each vehicle.
- **License Plate Recognition** – Extracts plate numbers using YOLO and OCR.
- **Timestamp Logging** – Stores vehicle entry and exit times for monitoring.
